# Straightedge-fe-core

Straightedge-fe is the event sniffer and event logger module for straightedge. The module hooks with the DOM and triggers events on the window object of the DOM. These events are meant only for [straight-edge-fe](https://github.com/Keith3895/straightedge-fe).

2) install dependencies:
    ``npm install``
3) build the application:
    ``npm run build-js``
4) copy the generated ``bundle.js`` file and paste it in the chrome console of the application you want to trace.
5) To start the trace run the command ``straightedgefe.run()`` in the chrome console.
6) run the command ``straightedgefe.stop()`` in the chrome console to end the trace. the command will show the trace as the result.
